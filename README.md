#Tiny Dungeon

A minimalistic Node.js D&D combat tracker and real time map.

Visit it in action [here](http://idiot.sh/tinydungeon).

Very much a work in progress and a project to learn Node.js and Koa. Future features include dungeon and map import (export is already working) and a better database structure.
